# Emotion Detection from Images using DeepFace

This project uses the pre-trained **DeepFace** model to detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions in images. It leverages deep learning and computer vision to identify emotions such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **surprise**, and more with high accuracy.

## 🔍 Features

- Emotion detection from static images
- Uses the powerful pre-trained **DeepFace** model
- Lightweight and easy to run
- No training required – ready to use
- Built with Python and OpenCV
